## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying bottlenecks within logistics operations by analyzing
delivery performance and shipping delays. Using SQL for data manipulation and Power BI
for visualization, raw shipment data was transformed into actionable business insights.

---

## Tech Stack
- SQL (PostgreSQL): Data cleaning, handling missing values, and aggregating shipping timelines
- Power BI: Interactive dashboard development and KPI tracking
- Data Source: Supply chain delivery dataset (Kaggle)

---

## Key Analysis & Insights
- Identified shipping modes that consistently exceed scheduled delivery timelines
- Analyzed delivery delays across geographic regions to highlight high-risk areas
- Compared late vs on-time delivery patterns to support logistics planning decisions

---

## Business Insights
- Certain shipping classes showed significantly higher average delays
- Specific regions exhibited consistent delivery risks
- Standard Class shipping demonstrated more reliable delivery performance

---

## Outcome
This analysis demonstrates how SQL-driven data exploration combined with
interactive dashboards can support data-informed decisions in supply chain operations.
